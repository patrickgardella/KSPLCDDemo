# KSPLCDDemo

A demo for how to use an 16x2 LCD with KSP to display live data from the game.

This is based on the work done by Zitron in his KSP [Arduino based physical display + serial port io+ tutorial](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/60281-hardware-plugin-arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-24-11-19/) and his [Arduino code](https://sites.google.com/site/zitronfiles/KSPIODemo17.zip)

This pulls out just the LCD code to demonstrate how it works. (And so I can use my LCD as a secondary screen to display flight data.)
