# KSPLCDDemo
Based on the work done by Zitron in his KSP "Arduino based physical display + serial port io+ tutorial"    https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/60281-hardware-plugin-arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-24-11-19/     And his Arduino code    https://sites.google.com/site/zitronfiles/KSPIODemo17.zip     This pulls out just the LCD code to demonstrate how it works. (And so I can use my LCD as a secondary screen to display flight data.)
